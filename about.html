      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello! I'm Ashton Alva, a Computer Science undergraduate at CSU Fullerton (expected March 2026), with a strong foundation in AI, software engineering, and full-stack development. I enjoy solving real-world problems with code and leading collaborative technical projects.</p>

      <p>My core interests include artificial intelligence, machine learning, cybersecurity, and full-stack systems using tools like React, Flask, and SQL. I'm deeply engaged in applying generative AI and cloud-based solutions to real use cases.</p>

      <p>I’ve served as a project lead in multiple academic software builds, and I’m always looking to grow as a developer through internships and open-source collaboration.</p>
